With this simple application users can search for tweets in the search box and have the most recent 20 revelant tweets display in list order. Users can also save any of the tweets by simply clicking on the check next to the tweet under the save column. You can then view all of your save tweets by clicking on the archiver button which will pop out a second window. In addition, viewers can read the source code of any tweet by checking the box under the pop column and then the pop button for that tweet.
