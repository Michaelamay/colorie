Seatly was created as a final project for HCI course. It aims to provide students a visual representation of available seats in the library. Users can view 4 different floorplans that represent John T Richardson Library at DePaul University. Seats colored in red represent occupy seats and green means the seat is currently vacant. Furthermore, users can reserve large furniture chairs which have limited availability.
